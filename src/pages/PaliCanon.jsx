        The Pali Canon is the oldest surviving Buddhist scripture. It is a
        collection of Buddhist suttas, or teachings of the Buddha, that are
        considered the most authoritative and important. The Pali Canon is the
        primary text from which all other Buddhist texts are derived.

      <p>
        The Pali Canon was written in the Pali language, a branch of the Indian
        language group. It is believed that the Pali Canon was written during
        the time of the Buddha, between 500 BCE and 300 BCE.

        The Pali Canon consists of five main collections of suttas, known as the
